# PyGwent
Minigame from The Witcher 3 - in Python (hun)

This small game was mode for a school project. It uses the basics of the Python language with the help of the Turtle graphics. The idea was to create a card game using simple objects and a rulebook, the gameplay emulates the original game with some minor changes. Some features are excluded from the original Gwent game ie. the spy feautre, or the training dummies.

All the original fractions (Northern Realms, Nilfgaard, Scoia'tael, Monster) and the DLC fraction (Skellige) are represented in this adaptation. They all have their unique passive abilities and the fraction cards. Special and neutral cards are implemented as well.

The requirement to win a game remained the same: the player who wins his second round first, wins the game. Draw if both reached second win in the same round (except if one of them used the Nilfgaardian deck (passive)).
